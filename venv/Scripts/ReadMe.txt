The given task of extracting instructed information using python code.
The text extraction is done using regular expression in the code. 

The fourth task was to find if there were any crashes in the log, I have assumed "Application exit due to critical failure" is the crashed case and I have extracted the date and timing.
The 3rd task was to find if there were any errors and warnings, so I found error and exited out of the loops. (Could have printed error or warning messages or number of error and warnings too).
First question was asking to find the version, since there is only one version all the time, didnt make sense to print software version all the time - which can be made to print software version each time application launches.

code can be executed using command line.

-> python LogAutomate.py > Output.txt


The output will be displayed in "output.txt" file.
